mod2doctest
===========

mod2doctest is a module that converts a python module to a doctest 
compatible docstring.  

It's kind of like taking a python script, pasting it into an interactive
interpreter and then copying the output back into a docstring.  

However, mod2doctest has many convenience to make this process easier like: 
  
  * Providing `#>` and `#|` comments: `#>` prints to both your docstring
    and stdout and `#|` print just to your docstring (which will show
    up as text in a sphinx generated webpage)
  
  * adding ellipse markers for memory id / trace back 
  
  * Cleaning up / formatting your docstring for sphinx inclusion 
  
  * and a couple of other things, too.
